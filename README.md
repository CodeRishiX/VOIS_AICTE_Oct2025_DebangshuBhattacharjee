# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis of the NYC Airbnb Market

Welcome to my project for the **Edunet Foundation X VOIS** virtual internship! This repository documents a comprehensive data analysis of the New York City Airbnb landscape, implemented in Python.

## üìù Project Summary

This project dives deep into the NYC Airbnb dataset to uncover patterns in pricing, availability, and guest satisfaction. The analysis begins with thorough data cleaning and preparation, followed by an investigation into the geographical distribution of listings across the city.

Key questions explored include:
* How are listings distributed across different boroughs?
* What is the relationship between property age and rental price?
* How strongly do service fees correlate with the final price?
* What do host activity and guest reviews tell us about the market?

## üíª Technology Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Core Libraries:**
    * `Pandas` & `NumPy` for data manipulation.
    * `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` for data visualization.
* **Deliverable:** The complete analysis is presented in a `Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)` file.
